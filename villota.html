            <h2>History:</h2>
            <p>The Ara Pacis Augustae, or Altar of Augustan Peace, was commissioned by the Roman Senate in 13 BCE to celebrate Emperor Augustus' return from successful military campaigns. Crafted from white marble, the altar, located in the Campus Martius, depicts scenes of the dedication ceremony and allegorical figures symbolizing peace and abundance. Designed to reinforce Augustus' authority and promote the idea of Pax Romana, the altar served as a powerful propaganda tool, extolling the emperor's achievements and the stability of the Roman Empire. Rediscovered in the 16th century, it wasn't until the 20th century that significant efforts were made to fully uncover and reconstruct the Ara Pacis, which now resides in the Ara Pacis Museum in Rome, showcasing its enduring significance as an iconic symbol of ancient Roman art and imperial ideology.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics of Artwork:</h2>
            <p>The Ara Pacis Augustae is primarily made of white marble. The subject of the artwork is the concept of peace (Pax) and the glorification of the reign of Emperor Augustus. The altar's reliefs depict various scenes, including a procession of members of the imperial family, priests, and officials, as well as representations of the Roman gods and personifications of peace and abundance. The overall message conveyed by the Ara Pacis Augustae is one of imperial power, prosperity, and the promise of peace under Augustus' rule. It served as a propaganda tool to promote the image of Augustus as a bringer of peace and stability to the Roman Empire.</p>
